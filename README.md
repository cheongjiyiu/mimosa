# Mimosa

![build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen) ![dependencies](https://img.shields.io/badge/dependencies-stable-brightgreen)

## Description

Systems rebooting, database dumping, used to be called SecureCoding, now given to juniors, and finally completely rewritten.

This is an opensource core; it excludes administrative controls.

## Features

- Lots of challenges
- References to modern pop culture

## Getting Started

Download the latest the Mimosa release [here](https://github.com/securecoding-mimosa/mimosa-core/releases/latest).
Place mimosa in a directory of your preference before running the following commands in a terminal.

```console
user@mimosa:~$ java -jar mimosa-core-<version>.jar -g sql
Package(s) created!
user@mimosa:~$ java -jar mimosa-core-<version>.jar -g properties
Package(s) created!
```

This will generate two packages, a `mimosa-dump.sql` database dump to run in a MySQL server of your choice,
and an `application.properties` file that you can use to configure your Mimosa settings.

Once configuration is complete, you can start Mimosa by running the following command: `java -jar mimosa-core.jar`

Access the web application by typing the url http://localhost in your preferred browser.

Afterwards, you can simply register an account, selecting the first class and your account will be auto approved. 

Login with your newly created account and try out Mimosa.

Enjoy!

```console
user@mimosa:~$ java -jar mimosa-core.jar
